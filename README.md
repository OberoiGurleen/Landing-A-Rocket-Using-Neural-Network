# Landing-A-Rocket-Using-Neural-Network
Task:
You are presented with a lander game which will randomly generate a landing zone
and unsafe terrain. You will be required to safely land the ship without touching the
unsafe terrain. Data will be generated following your completion of this task; you
must use this data to successfully train your own neural network with the ability to
complete the same task.
1) Design and implement a Feed-Forward Backpropagation neural network
where:
i. Inputs: 2 Lander sensors,
ii. Outputs: Lander thruster, Lander turning
2) Train your neural network in your Python implementation (offline training
~1000 epochs) with the data you have collected during your attempt at the
lander game.
3) Test your neural network by running the most recent weights (just feedforward) to see how the lander performs and compute the Root Mean
Squared Error.
